# MediBridge Bug Fixes

## Summary of Fixes

The primary issue was that dashboard pages were displaying as blank white screens. This was due to two main problems:

1. Icon implementations and component nesting issues across the application
2. Authentication problems causing 401 (Unauthorized) errors when navigating between dashboard sections

### Component Fixes:

1. **MobileNav Component**: 
   - Fixed improper nesting of anchor tags inside wouter Link components

2. **StatsCard Component**: 
   - Updated to use proper wouter Link tags instead of regular anchor tags

3. **HealthProfile Component**: 
   - Fixed Remix icon classes with proper react-icons imports
   - Added RiUser3Line component from react-icons
   - Added type interface for HealthProfileData to fix type errors
   - Fixed avatar fallback to handle undefined values

4. **DataAccessControl Component**: 
   - Added proper React icon imports (RiHospitalLine, RiUser6Line, RiTestTubeLine, RiAddLine)
   - Updated the ProviderAccessCard component to render icons correctly
   - Fixed "Add" button icon

5. **UpcomingAppointments Component**:
   - Added RiAddLine import
   - Fixed "Add new" button icon

6. **BlockchainVerification Component**:
   - SVG icons were already implemented correctly

7. **MedicalActivity Component**:
   - Fixed the RiFileTextLine, RiExchangeLine, RiTimerLine, RiShieldCheckLine, RiLockLine, RiAiGenerate imports

8. **AIConsultation Component**:
   - Icons were already implemented correctly using SVG components

### General Fixes:

1. **React Icons**: 
   - All components that were using Remix icon classes (ri-*) were updated to use proper react-icons/ri imports

2. **Authentication Context**:
   - Avatar image fallbacks were fixed to handle null or undefined values
   - Enhanced error logging and user feedback for authentication issues
   - Added toast notifications for session expiration

3. **Session Management**:
   - Fixed CORS configuration to properly support credentials
   - Updated session cookie settings to improve security and persistence
   - Added proper "credentials: include" setting to all API requests
   
4. **Start Script**: 
   - Created a proper start script for running the application

5. **Server-side Fixes**:
   - Fixed references to undefined user variable in storage.ts
   - Corrected sample data initialization to use the correct user variable
   - Fixed authentication persistence by ensuring correct user ID references

## Testing

The application has been tested and now successfully renders all dashboard components without blank screens.
