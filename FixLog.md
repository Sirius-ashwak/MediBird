The primary issue was that dashboard pages were displaying as blank white screens. This was due to multiple issues relating to icon implementations and component nesting across the application.

### Component Fixes:

8. **AIConsultation Component**:
   - Icons were already implemented correctly using SVG components

### General Fixes:

1. **React Icons**: 
   - All components that were using Remix icon classes (ri-*) were updated to use proper react-icons/ri imports

2. **Authentication Context**:
   - Avatar image fallbacks were fixed to handle null or undefined values
