# MediBridge Bug Fixes

## Summary of Fixes

The primary issue was that dashboard pages were displaying as blank white screens. This was due to several problems:

1. Icon implementations and component nesting issues across the application
2. Authentication problems causing 401 (Unauthorized) errors when navigating between dashboard sections
3. Issues with wallet ID handling in multiple components
4. Query error handling that caused crashes on auth failures
5. Route configuration issues that didn't properly handle nested routes

### Component Fixes:

1. **MobileNav Component**: 
   - Fixed improper nesting of anchor tags inside wouter Link components
   - Corrected wallet ID rendering to handle undefined values
   - Fixed Link imports to ensure proper single imports

2. **Protected Route Component**:
   - Updated to support both exact and nested routes

   - Added support for path wildcards to prevent navigation issues

3. **Query Client Configuration**:
   - Changed queryFn error handling from "throw" to "returnNull" to prevent crashes
   - Adjusted staleTime from Infinity to 60000ms for better data freshness
   - Reduced retries for better user experience when authentication fails

4. **Login Page**:
   - Simplified registration by making wallet ID auto-generated

   - Added better error handling for authentication failures
   - Ensured consistent headers across all API calls

3. **Server-side Fixes**:
   - Fixed references to undefined user variable in storage.ts

   - Fixed authentication persistence by ensuring correct user ID references

## Testing

The application has been tested and now successfully renders all dashboard components without blank screens or navigation issues.
